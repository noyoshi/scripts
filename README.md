# My Helpful Scripts, All in One Place # 

---

As a programmer, I will be making many scripts that are useful for me. The
first one I am thinking about is a python script which will alert me to the
change in currency trading prices every morning when I wake up, and if there
are any significant changes during the day. This helps me, as I often have cash
given to me as gifts in Yen, and would like to trade it to the dollar when the
Yen is at its strongest. In addition, monitoring crypto prices will help me
make informed decisions in how I invest monvey in the crypto scene. 

Other scripts might include: 
- [ ] Startup script, to help setup my developer enviornment?
